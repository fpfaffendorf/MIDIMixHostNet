# MIDIMixHostNet
Welcome to the GitHub repository for a .NET C# WinForms application that provides a seamless connection between an AKAI MIDIMix controller and up to 7 VSTs from Analog Lab. This application allows users to mix and blend the audio signals from these VSTs and route them to a Valhalla supermassive VST. Additionally, users can record the output of this mixer to a .wav file.

One of the standout features of this application is its ability to utilize the knobs and faders on the AKAI MIDIMix to control the parameters of the VSTs. This means that users can have hands-on control over the sound and effects produced by their VSTs without needing to use a mouse or keyboard.

Whether you're a music producer, sound designer, or someone who loves tinkering with audio effects, this application is a must-have for your toolkit. The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate and customize, while the advanced functionality provides endless possibilities for creativity and experimentation.
